## Hi, I'm Paul!

I'm a software engineering intern alum from the **Dev Degree** program at **Shopify**.

Prior to Dev Degree, I was a public school band director for 6 years.

## The story so far...

In **Dev Degree**, I got the opportunity to tinker with various parts of Shopify's tech stack and disciplines as I learned more about development. As my dev interests grow and take shape, I'll be honing this list into a more specialised skillset where I can show what I've picked up along the way.

### What Iâ€™ve fiddled with so far
